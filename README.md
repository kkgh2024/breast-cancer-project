## Motivation

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a common and dangerous type of breast cancer, making up about 80% of cases. It spreads quickly and can be hard to detect accurately. Doctors usually take tissue samples with a biopsy to check for IDC or other types of cancer. This testing is complex and depends a lot on the doctor's experience and equipment, so it takes time and might not always be consistent.

Using deep learning could change how we diagnose IDC by automating the process of finding cancer cells in tissue samples. By using large collections of images from different hospitals, analyzed by many experts, we could create a strong system to help diagnose cancer more efficiently. This technology could lessen the need for specialized doctors in places where they are scarce.

**Breast Cancer Statistics:**
In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported  [2.3 million](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer)cases of breast cancer among women, leading to 685,000 deaths globally. By the end of that year, about 7.8 million women had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the preceding five years, making it the most common cancer worldwide.Globally, female breast cancer ranks as the fifth leading cause of death.
## Challenge
Given a patient and a patch of tissue slice, predict whether it contains IDC or not, assisting with automatic tumor detection.

In this project, I used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of breast cancer, treating it as a classification problem.
